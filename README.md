CS 210 - Fall 2023-2024 Course Project Overview
Project Title: Research on My Activity Monitor Data of MacOS

Objective: The project aims to investigate and analyze resource utilization patterns on macOS, focusing on the correlation between application energy impact and CPU usage.

Project Phases:
1. Data Collection and Preparation:
Real-time metrics from macOS Activity Monitor were collected at 10-minute intervals.
Data was organized into an Excel workbook with separate sheets for CPU, Energy, and Memory usage.
2. Analysis and Interpretation:
Exploratory data analysis was conducted to identify patterns and trends in the acquired data.
Correlations between Energy Impact and CPU usage were calculated to extract insights for optimizing application efficiency.
3. Documentation and Finalization:
Methodology and findings were documented.
Recommendations for improving resource efficiency were provided.
The project report was finalized for presentation.
Key Components:
Data Import and Cleaning:
Data from Activity Monitor was extracted and converted into a structured format using Python.
Irrelevant columns and zero values were removed to ensure data accuracy.
Preliminary Analysis:
Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, etc.) were calculated for CPU, Energy, and Memory sheets.
Visualizations, such as histograms and pair plots, were generated to understand the distribution and relationships within the data.
Visualization and Interpretation:
Visualizations included histograms for CPU usage, scatter plots for Energy Impact vs. % CPU, and bar plots for top energy-impacting app names.
Interpretation focused on identifying outliers and trends in resource usage.
User Behavior Analysis:
User-specific analysis was performed for the user 'fipek,' highlighting top CPU processes and providing insights into user behavior.
Hypothesis Testing:
A hypothesis test was conducted to determine if there is a significant correlation between application energy impact and CPU usage.
Outlier Detection and Handling:
Outliers in Energy Impact and % CPU were identified and visually presented.
Statistical summaries were provided for datasets with and without outliers.
Conclusion:
The project uncovered valuable insights into resource utilization on macOS, providing a foundation for optimizing application performance and user experience. The comprehensive analysis, visualizations, and user-specific insights contribute to a well-rounded understanding of the data.
