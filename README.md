Research on macOS Activity Monitor Data Analysis

Introduction

Welcome to my CS 210 project, a comprehensive exploration of my macOS Activity Monitor data. The primary objective is to gain insights into the utilization of system resources by various applications, with a specific focus on understanding the correlation between energy impact and CPU usage.

Project Overview

Data Collection and Preparation: Real-time metrics from the Activity Monitor were collected, emphasizing Energy Impact, % CPU, threads, and memory usage. The meticulously organized data is stored in an Excel workbook with distinct sheets for CPU, Energy, and Memory.

Analysis and Interpretation: The project employs exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and trends. Key calculations, such as correlations between Energy Impact and CPU usage, are conducted to extract actionable insights for optimizing application efficiency.

Documentation and Finalization: Methodology, findings, and recommendations are documented in a detailed project report. The report serves as the final deliverable for presentation.
